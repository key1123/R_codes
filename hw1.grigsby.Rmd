# New problem
Suppose:  $X \sim Norm(6, 2)$.


# Using R to get the answer

I will save the x, mean, and standard deviation in different variables. After that I will compute the probability using pnorm.
```{r}
x <- 10
mu <- 6
sd <- 2
ans <- pnorm(x, mu, sd, lower.tail = FALSE)
ans
round(ans,2)
```
This answer says that there is very little chance that x is greater than 10 while $Norm(6,2)$

# Making a plot in R to tell the story
 
```{r}
n <- 10000
sample <- rnorm(n, mu, sd)
hist(sample)
```

# Impersonating a mathematician

Suppose:   $X \sim Norm(6, 2)$.


Find:  $P(X > 10)$.


Z-score Equation  $(x - mu) /\sigma$.

$(10- 6) / 2 $.

$ = 2$.

Our calculated z-score was 2 standard deviations above the mean

Now we have $P(Z < 2)$.

If we check a z=table for the score we get roughly around .02
