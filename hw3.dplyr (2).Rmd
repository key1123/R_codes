## Part 1

For the first part of this assignment we are asked to import the
libraries so that is what we will do.

```{r}
rm(penguins)
#install.packages('tidyverse') # run this once to download package to your machine
#install.packages('palmerpenguins') # run this once to download package to your machine
library(tidyverse) # run this everytime to load code from package to your current R session
library(palmerpenguins, quietly=TRUE)
```

The data set palmerpenguins provides overview of penguins from 3 different islands Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream.

These penguins were analyzed over the course of the years 2007, 2008, and 2009. Altogether three species of penguins were recorded.

To find these variables we just used the unique function on the column of choice. `unique(dataframe)`

The code should look like this `r unique(penguins['species'])`

We are given the variables bill length, bill depth, flipper length which
are all measured in millimeters. We are also given the body mass,
weighed in grams. We are also given the variable sex describing two genders. 
The variables island, species and sex were all set as factors so we will set
them as characters in the next code chunks. We have different ways to
count NA values for a data frame we can use the
`filter_all(any_vars(is.na(.)))` on the dataframe or we can use

```{r}
colSums(is.na(penguins))
```

These penguins came from a certain part of Antarctica, so we would
assume prior to analyzing any of the number that some measurements may
be extremely similar between species.

# Part 2

Now we will ad the columns continent, obs_age (for observed age), chest width, flipper length, and bill volume to the data frame.

First I use lubridate to add to column year without hard coding 2022.
and we also add the continent Antarctica for all of the columns. So
after running this line of code we will have added the continent and
data age to the dataframe.

```{r}

library(lubridate)

penguins <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(continent = 'Antarctica', obs_age = year(Sys.Date()) - year) %>% 
  select(island, continent, species, sex, year, obs_age, everything()) 
penguins
```

The next columns to add will be the chest width. We are assuming the
chect width of EVERY penguin is 80% of its flipper length. Add a column
for chest width measured in mm. Then add a column for flipper span = the
width of each penguin from flipper tip to flipper tip.

```{r}
penguins <- mutate(penguins, chest_width_mm = .80 * flipper_length_mm, 
                   flipper_span_mm = 2*flipper_length_mm + chest_width_mm)


```

For the last column we added in class we will compute the bill volume.
For this part of the assignment is was assumed that the bill was shaped
like a cone. the equation we will use for the bill volume follows
$$ V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h $$ we will have to use bill depth to find r
we then use bill legnth to find h From the sketch that Max drew we can
see that: $$ r = .5 * bill\_depth\_mm$$ and using the Pythagorean
theorem we get $$ h = \sqrt{bill\_length\_mm^2 - r^2}$$

```{r}
# intermediate results: 
r = .5 * penguins$bill_depth_mm
h = sqrt(penguins$bill_length_mm^2 - r^2)
# now ready for mutate()
penguins <- penguins %>% mutate(bill_volume = round(1/3 * pi * r^2 * h,1))
```
# Part 3

### a. penguins from Biscoe Island sampled after 2007 (all columns? YES because it doesn't give specifics)

```{r}
penguins %>% filter(island == 'Biscoe', year > 2007)
```
There were 124 penguins sampled from Biscoe island after 2007.

### a. bill-related variables for female Chinstrap penguins sampled in 2008

```{r}
penguins %>% filter(sex == 'female',species == 'Chinstrap', year == 2008 )  %>% select(contains("bill")) 
```

There were 9 female Chinstrap penguins sampled in 2008. Above is the data for their bill legnth, width, and volume.
### a. flipper-related variables for male penguins from Dream Island

```{r}
penguins %>% filter(sex == 'male',island == 'Dream')  %>% select(starts_with("flipper")) 

```

### a. the top ten male penguins based on body mass

```{r}
penguins %>% filter(sex == 'male')  %>% arrange(desc(body_mass_g)) %>% head(10)

```

### a. the top twenty Chinstrap penguins based on bill volume

```{r}
penguins %>% filter(species == 'Chinstrap')  %>% arrange(desc(bill_volume)) %>% head(20)

```
